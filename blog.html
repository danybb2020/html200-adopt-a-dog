        <p>
          <br />Straight to the Point Archery is a non profit archery education
          center founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen. Our state of the art
          educational and training facility incorporates detailed technical
          video analysis combined with generations of archery experience from
          certified coaches and instructors.

          <br /><br />
          Straight to the Point Archery is an indoor training facility with 28
          shooting (14 - 10 yard lanes and 14 – 20 yard lanes) and 2 private
          coaching rooms. We also have access to 26 additional 20 yard lanes and
          an outdoor shooting field. We offer several types of lessons to
          accommodate everyone from the first time archer to the professional
          archer. Once set up with proper fitting equipment, each archer will be
          given the basic safety instruction to start and will be introduced to
          various shooting techniques.

          <br /><br />From Beginner to Elite, archers of all ages and ability
          learn about this exciting Olympic and international sport. Sign up for
          a group lesson, private class, schedule a birthday or corporate party
          or compete at one of our many tournaments. Straight to the Point
          Archery also offers homeschooling programs, kids club events, YMCA
          classes, Boy and Girl Scouts achievement programs and several other
          youth group activities. We are dedicated to teaching valuable life
          skills to the youth in our community through the wonderful discipline
          of archery.
